&lt;h2 id=&#34;-initial-situation&#34;&gt;ðŸ“¦ Initial Situation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of an SAP S/4HANA migration, I focused on improving business processes. The central question was how the new ERP system could positively influence existing workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One key challenge was achieving reliable results quickly with limited resources. My specific task was to transition the picking warehouse from a fixed-location storage system to a chaotic (random) storage approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the analysis showed that an isolated change in warehouse strategy would not provide a sustainable solution in the context of a system conversion. Instead, the focus shifted toward a holistic view of end-to-end processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
