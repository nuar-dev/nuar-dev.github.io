> When people talk listen completely. Donâ€™t be thinking what youâ€™re going to say. Most people never listen. Nor do they observe. You should be able to go into a room and when you come out know everything that you saw there and not only that. If that room gave you any feeling you should know exactly what it was that gave you that feeling.

I work where technology and business meet. I turn complex matters into clear decisions. I listen, ask the necessary questions, and align goals to measurable outcomes. Requirements become prioritized backlogs, assumptions become testable hypotheses, and roadmaps become releases. I translate between domain language and engineering-precise, candid, pragmatic. Analysis is my tool; transparency is my style. I make data-informed decisions and refine them with feedback. I treat tension as a signal: I create shared mental models of processes, interfaces, and risks - and ensure teams share them. In the end, impact is what counts: that users understand, teams deliver reliably, and systems remain stable. For that, I bring structure, empathy, and a dash of dry humor.
